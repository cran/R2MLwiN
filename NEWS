1. Bug fixing
   * Missing values are erroneously marked as 'infinite' when re-fitting non-Normal models in debugmode, thus resulting in errors
   
Fri Mar 28 2014
1. Bug fixing
   * Fixed display when interaction terms involve
   * Fixed display when >1 non-Normal response
   * Correctly handle bcons parameters

Thu Mar 7 2014
1. Bug fixing
   * Fixed residuals for multivariate response models
   * Appropriate MCMC residuals now returned
   * Fixed bug: now allows for >2 responses in multivariate response model
   * Fixed CaterpillarR function
2. Changes
   * Removed option to specify resioptions = c("sampling") for MCMC estimation

Wed Feb 26 2014
1. Changes
   * Added 'optimat' option

Fri Jan 24 2014
1. Bug fixing
   * Fixed bug in Untoggle which was mis-assigning names to categories
2. Changes
   * Tested the package running on MLwiN v2.29; now changed default MLwiNPath

Thu Nov 21 2013
1. Bug fixing
   * sixway now allows user to specify some graphic parameters (see par()); This fixes errors, e.g., "figure margins too large".
   * Corrected error when workdir path contains spaces in ws2foreign.r.
   * fixed a bug in Formula.translate. The backward compatibility was not working; this has been removed since we support R 2.14.0 onwards.
   * Write.dta now saves as version=10 to circumvent problem of MLwiN mishandling missing values in .dta files saved under earlier versions of Stata. (Although this will be addressed in future release of MLwiN.)

2. Changes
   * Added an option to use R formula objects (i.e., without quotes around the character formula). NOTE that if an R formula is used, 0c, 0s,..., have to be changed to `0c`, `0s`,.... Any curly bracket, {}, has to be changed to a round bracket, ().
   * Added an update method for mlwinfitIGLS and mlwinfitMCMC class objects.
   * Added some example datasets and their related help files.
   * predLines(i.e., predLines1 & predLines2) and predCurves(i.e., predLines3) now depend on lattice package.

1. Bug fixing
   * When a model is run using MCMC, iterations (as set by the user in mcmcMeth) now refers to total chain run (post-burnin), rather than stored iterations only (relevant when thinning >1).
   * An MLwiN MCMC run no longer redundantly occurs when use BUGO with EstM=1 (e.g. when setting mcmcOptions).
   * Changed assignment of BUGO arguments from being solely determined by the order in which they're written, to instead determined by keywords.
   * MCSE algorithm now handles thinning appropriately.
   * sixway now handles thinning appropriately, and also swapped trace plot axis labels so that now correctly-labelled.
   * Corrected the summary and print functions to operate as expected.
   * Corrected error in number of observations returned in model summary: now corresponds to non-missing observations (with total in parentheses).
   * 'Conf' interval now referred to as 'Cred' interval in MLwiN MCMC output.
   * Corrected error when workdir path contains spaces.
   * Corrected generation of missing indicator in imputation data.

2. Changes
   * BUGO (used to call WinBUGS / OpenBUGS) now supports >1 chain.
   * Added debug and seed options to BUGO.
   * Removed redundant creation of combined BUGS files (bugofile; all BUGS files still returned separately).
   * Calling BUGS now returns summary of mcmc.list instead of MLwiN IGLS output (chains.bugs no longer returned).
   * All chains returned from an MCMC run in MLwiN are now mcmc objects.
   * Added option to display Bayesian one-sided p-value instead of z-ratio and its associated p-value in MCMC output from MLwiN (the default is z.ratio = T).
   * Global options 'digits' and 'show.signif.stars' now enabled, allowing users to specify the number of digits to display in the summary model output, as well as whether to display the stars which signify p-value thresholds, or not.
   * MCSE now handles mcmc objects, and handles thinning appropriately.
   * sixway now takes an mcmc object.
   * In sixway, Raftery-Lewis now returns error message when chain's too short for it to be calculated.
   * Changed default version MLwiN to 2.27.
   * Updated demos and help files.

Tue Feb 12 2013
1. Bugs fixing
   * For cross-classified models, only the residuals and their SE are returned from MCMC fitting.
2. Testing on MLwiN 2.27.

Mon Feb 04 2013
1. Bugs fixing
   * an issue on dropping a covariance from a model

Tue Jan 15 2013
1. Bugs fixing by Thomas Arkens
   * add multiple categorical variables in the fixed terms.
   * fix the reference categories (by changing to the level number of the factor object in R.)
2. Changes
   * in sixway(), replace getOption("device")() by windows(), so the package works in Rstudio.

Thu Nov 15 2012
1. New features
   * add various options for calculating residuals at all levels.

Thu Oct 18 2012
1. New features
   * add functionality to centre the explanatory variables.

Tue Oct 09 2012
1. Changes
   * the output of a fitted model is now a S4 class object consisting of print, "[", "[<-" and summary methods.
   * drop "$" to get an element of the output object.

2. New features
   * add macros to do weighting on all the levels when using IGLS.
